A Foundry VTT adaptation of a high level adventure by Prince of Nothing. For use with the Advanced Roleplaying System. You can support the author by buying the PDF here: https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/458449/slyth-hive

## Description
What once was, shall be again. The evil Pharnabazus, high priest of Shub-Niggurath, has ventured into Old Agoiah, and with the aid of evil sorcery, has re-awakened an ancient terror. The Slyth, a weapon race of the primordial Axototli civilization, has been reborn from the Wells of Lazarus at the hands of the Arch-Heretic. Reports of missing huntsmen, depopulated forests and sightings of eerie, primeval monstrosities begin to filter in from this decrepit backwater region. 

For OSRIC and other editions for the World's Most Popular Roleplaying Game. An adventure for characters of Level 14+!

Within the pages of this final boss of NAP III, you will find the following:

* 10+ Deadly creatures to test the mettle of even the mightiest heroes
* Magic items to fill the vaults of Archmages, including new ones: The Rod of All Flesh, the Living Armor and the Bone Mask
* Lethal environmental hazards: horrific fungi, the deepest jungle, the depths of the underwater ocean, the annihilating Anti-magic caverns and more!
* Innovative mechanics that put pressure on players and forces them to change tactics
* Comprehensive gauntlet of attrition that requires both tactical and strategic thinking and tests both system mastery and raw cunning and bravery
* Nine challenging levels
* Combat against hundreds of enemies
* 12+ exciting pregens so you don’t have to play AD&D 1e for 8 years before trying it out, including Vaus Arghul - Master of Summer, Solomon - Archmage of Forces, the unstoppable Brandoch Daha - wielder of the Hammer of Thunderbolts, Gauntlets of Ogre Power and Belt of Stone Giant Strength and Kent.
